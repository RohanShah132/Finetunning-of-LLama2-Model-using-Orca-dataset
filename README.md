# Finetunning-of-LLama2 Using Orca dataset

This project involves fine-tuning **LLaMA2**, a large-scale language model, using the **Orca dataset**. The objective was to improve the model's ability to understand and generate domain-specific text relevant to the dataset. Techniques like transfer learning were applied to adapt LLaMA2 to specialized tasks, ensuring it delivers more accurate and context-aware responses. The fine-tuning process also involved evaluating the model's performance on various natural language processing benchmarks to assess improvements in language understanding.
